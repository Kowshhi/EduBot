The literature includes poems and epics that provide valuable insights into the social, political, and economic life of the Tamil people during that period.The Chera Dynasty:The Chera dynasty, which had its capital in modern-day Kerala, controlled a significant part of Tamil Nadu during the Sangam period.

The Cholas were known for their military might, cultural achievements, and maritime prowess. The dynasty reached its zenith during the reign of Rajendra Chola I, who expanded the Chola Empire to include parts of Southeast Asia.The Pandyas:The Pandyas, who ruled over the southern part of Tamil Nadu, were known for their patronage of art, literature, and architecture.
