                            <option value="Tamil Nadu is a state located in the southern part of India and has a rich and diverse history that dates back to ancient times.

Prehistoric Period:
The earliest traces of human habitation in Tamil Nadu date back to the Paleolithic era, around 300,000 years ago. Excavations in the region have uncovered stone tools, weapons, and pottery from this period.

Indus Valley Civilization:
The Indus Valley Civilization (3300 BCE to 1300 BCE) is believed to have extended into the southern part of India. Archaeological evidence from Tamil Nadu shows that the civilization had a presence in the region, with artifacts such as seals and pottery being found at sites like Adichanallur and Kaveripakkam.

Sangam Period:
The Sangam period (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE) marked a significant period of Tamil history, which saw the development of Tamil literature and the emergence of three Tamil dynasties - the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas. The period is named after the famous Sangam literature, which was composed during this time. The literature includes poems and epics that provide valuable insights into the social, political, and economic life of the Tamil people during that period.

The Chera Dynasty:
The Chera dynasty, which had its capital in modern-day Kerala, controlled a significant part of Tamil Nadu during the Sangam period. The Cheras were known for their extensive trade relations with the Roman Empire and other parts of the world. They also had a strong navy, which helped them maintain their dominance in the region.

The Chola Dynasty:
The Chola dynasty, which emerged in the 9th century CE, was one of the most powerful dynasties in South India. The Cholas were known for their military might, cultural achievements, and maritime prowess. The dynasty reached its zenith during the reign of Rajendra Chola I, who expanded the Chola Empire to include parts of Southeast Asia.

Satyamurti, and K. Kamaraj.

Modern Period:
Tamil Nadu was formed as a state in India in 1956, and since then, it has become one of the most prosperous and progressive states in the country. It is known for its rich culture, art, music, and literature, and has made significant contributions to the fields of science, technology, and education.

                            <option value="General purpose education is an education that is intended to provide a broad and comprehensive understanding of a wide range of subjects. It is designed to equip individuals with the knowledge, skills, and competencies that are necessary for personal and professional success in a rapidly changing world.

General purpose education typically includes subjects such as language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and physical education, as well as other elective courses that enable students to explore their interests and passions. The goal of general purpose education is to help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration skills that are essential for success in the 21st century.

General purpose education is important because it provides individuals with the foundational knowledge and skills that they need to be successful in a wide range of career paths and to be responsible and engaged members of society.

                            <option value="General sciences refer to the fundamental branches of science that provide a basic understanding of the natural world. These sciences are usually divided into three main categories: physical sciences, life sciences, and earth sciences.

Physical sciences include physics, chemistry, and astronomy, which deal with the study of matter, energy, and the laws that govern the natural world. Physics is concerned with the properties of matter and energy, and their interactions. Chemistry studies the composition, properties, and behavior of matter, and how it changes. Astronomy studies celestial objects such as stars, planets, and galaxies.

Life sciences, also known as biological sciences, include biology, zoology, botany, and microbiology. These sciences are concerned with the study of living organisms and their relationships with each other and with their environment. Biology is the study of living organisms and their functions, while zoology focuses on animal life. Botany is the study of plants, and microbiology deals with the study of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Earth sciences include geology, meteorology, and oceanography, which focus on the study of the physical components and processes of the Earth. Geology studies the physical structure and properties of the Earth, while meteorology is the study of the Earth's atmosphere and weather patterns. Oceanography deals with the study of the ocean, including its physical properties, marine life, and oceanic processes.

General sciences provide a broad and comprehensive understanding of the natural world, and they are essential for many different career paths, including medicine, engineering, and environmental science. They also help us to understand and address many of the challenges facing our planet today, such as climate change, pollution, and disease.

                            <option value="Finance is an important function of any business, as money is required to meet the various activities of it. It has given birth to “Financial Management” as a separate subject. The subject is of recent origin. It draws heavily on “Economics” for its theoretical concepts. In the early half of the 20th century the job of financial management was largely confined to the acquisition of funds. But as business firms continued to expand their markets and became larger and more diversified, greater control of financial operation became highly essential. Definition
“Finance is defined as the provision of money at the time when required. Every enterprise, whether big, medium, small needs finance to carry on the business operations to achieve their targets”.
Thus the scope of financial management is very wide and it is not merely restricted to rising of capital. It also covers other aspects of financing such as assessing the needs of capital, raising sufficient amount of funds, cost of financing, budgeting, maintaining liquidity, lending and borrowing policies, dividend policy, and so on. Financial management occupies a significant place because it has an impact on all the activities of a firm. Its primary responsibility is to discharge the finance function successfully. 
Thus financial management is an appendage of the finance function. No one can think of any business activity in isolation from its financial implications. The management may accept or reject a business proposition on the basis of its financial viabilities. In other words, the live executives who are directly involved in the decision making process should give supreme importance for financial considerations.
The need for money is continuous. It starts with the setting up of an enterprise and remains at all times. The development and expansion of the business needs more commitment for funds. These funds have to be raised from various sources. The inflow and outflow of funds should properly match. The finance is the nerve centre of the business. It is essential to the smooth running of the business. 
Finance involves three important functions. Whether the enterprise is public or private, it involves rising of funds, investment of funds and utilization of returns earned from investment. These functions are known as financing investment and dividend decision respectively.
